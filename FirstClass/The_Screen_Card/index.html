      <h1>The Scream</h1>
      <p>
        The Scream is the popular name given to a composition created by Norwegian artist Edvard Munch in 1893. The
        agonized face in the painting has
        become one of the most iconic images of art, seen as symbolizing the anxiety of the human condition. Munch's
        work, including The Scream, would
        go on to have a formative influence on the Expressionist movement.

        Munch recalled that he had been out for a walk at sunset when suddenly the setting sun's light turned the clouds
        "a blood red".
        He sensed an "infinite scream passing through nature". Scholars have located the spot to a fjord overlooking
        Oslo and have suggested other
        explanations for the unnaturally orange sky, ranging from the effects of a volcanic eruption to a psychological
        reaction by Munch to his
        sister's commitment at a nearby lunatic asylum.

        Munch created two versions in paint and two in pastels, as well as a lithograph stone from which several prints
        survive. Both painted versions have been stolen,
        but since recovered. One of the pastel versions commanded the fourth highest nominal price paid for an artwork
        at a public auction. The Norwegian title is Skrik
        (Shriek), and the German title was Der Schrei der Natur (The Scream of Nature).
